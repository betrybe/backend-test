# Phoenix.View

The view layer in Phoenix v1.0-v1.6 apps.

With `Phoenix.LiveView`, `Phoenix.View` has fallen out of fashion in favor
of `Phoenix.Component`. See the "Replaced by `Phoenix.Component`" section
in the [`Phoenix.View`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_view/Phoenix.View.html)
module documentation for more information and migration steps (if desired).

## Installation

You can install `phoenix_view` by adding it to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_view, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
```
